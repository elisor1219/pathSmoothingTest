You can run the code in the `main.m` file. 
This file will generate two diffrent .png files, one based on Catmull Rom
spline, the other one based on a B-spline. 

Sorry about the messy code... 

#### Issues
I currently feel like the ideas I had before are making the code hard to work with. 
I was thinking it, for some reason, would be nice to have the GUI inside some of the NURBS code, and that does not make any sense.
Would be better to have the NURBS class only for NURBS...
